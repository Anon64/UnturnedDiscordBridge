# UnturnedDiscordBridge
A node.js server to work with the [UnturnedDiscordBridge](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UnturnedDiscordBridge/) plugin.
I wrote this program for a small discord server of mine, this may not work for you!

Edit the config.yaml file in `plugins/Anon64.UnturnedDiscordBridge/config.yaml` to change pipe names if you'd like.

## How to use
1. Download zip
2. Extract to folder
3. Edit `config.json`
4. Run the server (`node index.js`)
