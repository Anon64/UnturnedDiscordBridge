# UnturnedDiscordBridge
A node.js server to work with the [UnturnedDiscordBridge](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UnturnedDiscordBridge/) plugin.
~~**This plugin only works on linux!!!**~~ (I would have to edit the nuget package to make it work on windows)
I wrote this program for a small discord server of mine, this may not work for you!

## How to use
1. Download zip
2. Extract to folder
3. Edit `config.json`
4. Run the server (`node index.js`)
